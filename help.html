  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <p><strong>Q. Is SportRing free to use?</strong><br>
  A. Yes. The app is currently available for free during the beta period.
We may consider a paid version in the future, but all features are open to try right now.</p>
  <p><strong>Q. Can I use it with Apple Watch only?</strong><br>
  A. Yes. SportRing works independently on Apple Watch.
You can check your progress and change your goals, units, or ring color directly from your Watch.</p>
  <p><strong>Q. Does it sync automatically with iPhone?</strong><br>
  A. Yes. Your Watch and iPhone sync automatically.
Any changes made on one device are reflected on the other.</p>
  <p><strong>Q. How does SportRing handle Walk and Run tracking?</strong><br>
  A. SportRing allows you to track walking and running separately — a feature not available in Apple’s built-in Health app.</p>
  <p><strong>Q. Where is my data stored?</strong><br>
  A. All your data is stored safely on your device through Apple’s HealthKit.
No information is sent to external servers or shared with third parties.</p>

  <p><strong>Q. How to change the app language?</strong><br>
  A. Adding the SportRing widget to your Home Screen lets you check your progress anytime.  
  The app and widget language follow your iPhone’s language settings.  
  You can change the display language using the steps below.
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Open iPhone Settings</strong><br>
      Go to Settings → SportRing → Preferred Language.</li>

  <li><strong>Select your preferred language</strong><br>
      Choose English, Japanese, or the language you want to use.</li>

  <li><strong>If you also want the widget language to update</strong><br>
      If the widget does not switch languages, restart your Apple Watch to apply the change.</li>
</ol>

  <br>
  <h2>🛠️ Troubleshooting</h2>
  <h3>Widget language not changing</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Check iPhone system language</strong><br>
      Settings → General → Language & Region → iPhone Language.  
      Make sure the language you want is selected.</li>

  <li><strong>Check SportRing app-specific language</strong><br>
      Settings → SportRing → Preferred Language.  
      Ensure the desired language is selected.</li>

  <li><strong>Restart both devices</strong><br>
      Restart your iPhone and Apple Watch after changing language settings  
      to ensure the widget reloads correctly.</li>
</ol>
  <h3>Data or settings are not syncing</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Re-enter your settings and tap “Save” again</strong> (e.g., goal distance, unit, ring color).</li>
    <li>Open SportRing on both your iPhone and Apple Watch and keep them in the foreground for a few seconds.</li>
    <li>Ensure Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are enabled, and Airplane Mode is off.</li>
    <li><strong>Check Health permissions</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>iPhone Settings: <em>Settings → Privacy &amp; Security → Health → SportRing</em></li>
        <li>or Health app: <em>Profile → Apps → SportRing</em></li>
        <li>Make sure all workout-related categories are <strong>enabled (green)</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If it still doesn’t sync, restart both your Apple Watch and iPhone, then try again.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Rings not updating</h3>
  <p>Please recheck the <strong>Health permissions</strong> above. If permissions are disabled, rings and graphs will not update.</p>
