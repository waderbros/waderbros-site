  <h2>1. Basic Policy</h2>
  <p>SportRing (“the App”) is an activity tracking app for Apple Watch and iPhone.<br>
  We respect your privacy and are committed to handling personal and health-related data safely and responsibly.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collected</h2>
  <p>The App uses Apple’s HealthKit framework to access:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Walking and running distance data</li>
    <li>Activity statistics</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is used only for displaying your progress as rings and graphs within the app.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Sharing</h2>
  <p>All collected data is stored securely on your device.<br>
  No data is transmitted to, or shared with, any third parties.</p>

  <h2>4. Use of HealthKit</h2>
  <p>SportRing integrates with Apple’s HealthKit to read and display activity data.<br>
  HealthKit data is managed in compliance with Apple’s guidelines and is never used for other purposes without explicit user consent.</p>

  <h2>5. Advertising and Analytics</h2>
  <p>The App does not currently include ads or third-party analytics tools.<br>
  If these features are added in the future, users will be informed in advance.</p>

  <h2>6. About Paid Version and Data Handling</h2>
  <p>The App is currently available for free as a beta version.<br>
  We may consider a paid version in the future, but this will not affect how your data is handled — your privacy will remain protected.</p>
